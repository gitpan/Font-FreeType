 * The methods that return bitmap images have been changed to also return
   the left and top offsets of the bitmap from the origin of the glyph, so
   that the images can be properly positioned within a larger picture.
 * Added the svg_path() method and an example for generating an SVG image
   showing a single glyph.
 * Better checking in $ft->version().
 * Make sure that glyph outlines can be accessed even if the first thing
   done to a glyph is to get its bitmap.  Added tests for doing this both
   ways round.  The solution could be better though.
 * Added methods $face->ascender() and $face->descender().
 * Added method $glyph->bitmap_magick() and an example program demonstrating
   its use, as well as using ImageMagick drawing functions to render outlines.
 * Added test for POD correctness.
 * Provided a better META.yml file.
 * Minor change to typemap for older Perls.
